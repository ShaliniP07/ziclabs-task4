## Author: Shalini P
## Batch: (1 November- 30 November,2023)
## Domain: 
JAVA Programming
## Aim: 
To build an ATM Interface
## Descripton/Working of code:
1. Startup: When the code is run, the main function of the ATMInterface class is called. It initializes the account balance variable to 0.

2. Menu: The code displays a menu to the user with options to deposit, withdraw, check the account balance, or exit the ATM.

3. User Input: The user is prompted to enter the option number they want to perform. Based on the input, the switch-case structure directs the control flow to the corresponding block of code.

4. Performing Transactions: The program then takes appropriate actions based on the user's choice. For deposit, it asks the user to enter the amount to be deposited and adds it to the current balance. For withdrawal, it checks if the user's account balance is sufficient to cover the withdrawal amount. If it is, the withdrawal amount is deducted from the balance. Otherwise, an "Insufficient Balance" message is displayed.

5. Repeat: The menu and user input options are displayed again, allowing the user to continue using the ATM until they choose to exit. When the user selects option 4, the program terminates.
